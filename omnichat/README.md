## What do you plan to achieve with your project?

- If Push allows us to keep working on this project, we plan to create an official push bot that will be able to operate on Push, Discord, and Telegram. 
- We could for instance, relay push notifications through the same bot to other platforms. 
- Build a front-end where users can deploy and manage their bot specs.

## Lessons Learned (For Submission)

- Every thing was very light, the API's are very easy to use and work pretty well.
- The Threads in the telegram were not responding as expected, and due to the time constraints we were not able to fix it.
